<h2 class="read" style="text-align:left"> Project Scratch <h2>

 <img align="center" src="Scratch P3.png" width="450" height="200" />

<h4 class="read"style="text-align:left"> This project was made in Scratch, it was a drang and drop coding format. I designed a maze game where you can choose one of three characters. Once a character was chosen you would be dropped into a maze where the goal was an apple. This was the first project that made me look at how much has to go into a game. For example choosing a character required that each other character had to disappear, then the one you choose would have to be resized and moved to the starting location.  <h4>


<h2 class="read"style="text-align:left"> Code.Org<h2>
<img align="center" src="Code.org P4.png" width="450" height="200" />
<h4 class="read"style="text-align:left"> This project was made in Code.Org, it was a drag and drop coding format. The goal of this project was to get more familair with what coding can do. I am a game where a cat would case a witch which is player controlled. If the cat touched you you would loose. I also had to at a score meter in the form  of a timer. There wer also obsticals that the player nor cat could move through. I believe this was the first time that I have any for of colission between two moving objects. I remeber trying out a few different games but decided to go with a an eaiser game that what my ambisions wanted because I just did not have the skill or time to figure out how to do something more complicated.  <h4>

<h2 class="read"style="text-align:left"> Alice<h2>
<h4 class="read"style="text-align:left"> This project was made in Alice, it was what seemed to be a bridge between drag and drop coding format and text based coding format. I was unable to get a screenshot of this project, but I think that is kind of fitting. I was unable to completely finish this project, as I think my mind was bigger than my stomach. I made a choose your own adventure game where you would talk to different characters. This quickly spiraled into a lot of responses I would have to make. I got done with three characters and it ended up being a lot of work to make conversation happen with multiple outcomes. I think Alice was my least favorite project that we have done.   <h4>

<h2 class="read"style="text-align:left"> Web Project<h2>
<h4 class="read"style="text-align:left"> Using HTML to make a webpage this project spanned over a few weeks. I really enjoyed the progress of this project. First, we just had to figure out how to make things appear on the page. Next, we added style to it. Last but certainly not least we had to add functionality. I think over all this was my favorite project, mainly because it felt like we were building upon what we were learning in previous weeks. I have said it once before but switching coding environments every week felt jarring.   <h4>


<h2 class="read"style="text-align:left"> Self Portrait<h2>
<img align="center" src="Self portriat P10.png" width="400" height="400" />
<h4 class="read" style="text-align:left"> This project was an expansion of what we did with HTML and JavaScript and CSS. We now were learning to make shapes and place them where we wanted them to be, as well as setting colors. At first, I felt intimated in making a self-portrait as I did not think it would be easy to make anything remotely close. The example of the project really helped; in that it gave a proportional expectation. I liked this project because it was the first time, I had been able to go in and just start. On all of the other projects it felt like something brand new, this one however was a continuation.  <h4>

<h2 class="read"style="text-align:left"> Dodge<h2>
<img align="center" src="Dodge P11.png" width="400" height="400" />
<h4 class="read"style="text-align:left"> Another HTML/JavaScript/CSS project. This one had us returning to the idea of making a game, however it was more closed ended. We were to make a character move around the screen and a goal that would display a you win message. I think the most interesting / complicated part was the enemies. They had to move at random speeds in random directions, and the hardest part to figure out was making them appear on the other side of the screen. I felt as if I spoiled that last bit for myself. I was just glancing that the example provided and say how that was done, which after trying my first two-ish ideas for how to do just ended up using what I saw in the example.   

   <h4>

<h2 class="read"style="text-align:left"> Final<h2>

<h4 class="read" style="text-align:left"> I decided to make my final would be a  HTML/JavaScript/CSS, as it was my favorite part of the class. I spent some time trying to think of an idea that would be doable. After a while I had some ideas that I think were to much to try and do at my current skill level. I did like the idea of doing a final portfolio however. It had a good since of everything coming full circle. I eneded up adding this onto the web project. I think it would have been cool to have the HTML/JavaScript/CSS projects be more than a screenshot, and be active but after some trial and error I couldn't get everything align right not could I really get them running independatly.  This class has been more fun than I expected and only frustrating occasionally.
