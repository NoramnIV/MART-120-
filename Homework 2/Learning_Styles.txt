Learning 

	I think a lot of teachers understand that different students learn differently and can make exercises that can help them. I think that is true for most of pre-college teachers. In college, I have noticed it is really up to the students to learn, and the teachers use auditory, and a bit of visual teaching methods and I totally get why, like imaging being in Cal 2 and making a tactile representation of a integral. I do not think it would work out well and would take up a lot of time making sure each student could have some experience with it being tactile.  

	I would say that I can utilize the three methods really well. I not entirely sure which ones I lean towards the most. I think it more depends on the actual information I am trying to learn. On tests there have been times when I recall a hands-on experience or an exact wording of when a teacher has said something, or even just remembering an entire page of notes. I think I kind of got lucky with that, I have seen my friends who canâ€™t do one or more of the learning styles really struggle if that is all the teachers use.
