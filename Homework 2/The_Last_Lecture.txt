Last Lecture  

	Watching the Last Lecture had me thinking about my childhood dreams. A better way to say it though would be a lack of dreams. Growing up I never had anything super specific that I wanted to do. Not saying I wasn’t motivated, just never really felt like I was working towards grand plans. The closest thing I can think of was just the goal of being happy. Young me had no idea of what being happy might involve, and I am still figuring that out and will likely continue to do so for most of my life.  

	I had a hard time pinning down the exact message he was trying to produce. It was a combination of don’t let your dreams be dreams and success story and autobiography, with a hit of motivating others. He seemed to want people to be motivated, which is interesting because so far in college my experance has been people are already here because they were motivated and not here to get motivated. The teachers also seem to feel this way as they are focused on teaching the subject of academics and really helping students grow as people.
