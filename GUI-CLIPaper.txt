When looking at the two user interfaces, I naturally like the GUI as it is more visual and what I have seen most often. Command line I have used but I always perfer GUI, it just feels cleaner and in my opinion is easier to spot potenial mistakes. Like for some reason my command line wont let me get into my documents folder that I have been using in the way that I would have expected, instead it is under a different dircector that I am not entirely sure how to get to using command line.

I also think that GUI is more effective, just the idea of folders being one or two clicks away. Where as with command line you need to type a good amount out to find the file you are looking for. I do know about the auto fill feature as well but still.

Most of my experience with command line is monkey see monkey do, I don't entirely understand what I am doing, but I know it works. Take my job for example, I work at the campus IT, and some times we have to give perffesors admin on their machine but only when the request it, and so in command line we have to run a command to add them to a local group that has access to the Make ME Admin app, but if you asked me to do that with out instructions I would have no idea.
